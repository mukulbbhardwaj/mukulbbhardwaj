## 🧠 About

I’m a backend-focused product engineer who enjoys taking ideas from messy workflows to production-ready systems.

My work lives at the intersection of:

* scalable backend architecture
* automation & scraping infrastructure
* AI-driven tooling
* multi-tenant product systems

I care about reliability, performance, and building things people actually use.
